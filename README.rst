Django Begin
============

This is a series of standard templates to work with django-startproject.py which creates
templated django projects.  There may be more than one template here:

project_template_basic:
    this is the basic do-it-all template, that is pretty much exactly
    the same as the project_template that comes with django-startproject, with a bunch
    of tweaks to suit my own deployment style.

More templates will be added as needed.
